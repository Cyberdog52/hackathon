# Java Fullstack Hackathon 2024

---

The project is split into four folders

- java-backend
- dotnet-backend
- react-frontend
- angular-frontend

You should be able to combine both backends with any of the frontends interchangeably. \
You will decide with your team which technologies to use.

## Setup

If your setup already has some of the required tools installed, please adjust accordingly.

1. Both frontends need Node to run. Install newest Node from here https://nodejs.org/en/ (currently 20.11.1 LTS)
2. Run `npm install -g npm@10.5.0`
3. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@17.2.3`
4. Verify your versions with `ng version`:  
   Angular CLI: **17.2.3** \
   Node: **20.11.1** \
   Package Manager: npm **10.5.0**
4. Install a new version of IntelliJ or VSCode
5. Clone the master branch with `git clone https://github.com/Cyberdog52/hackathon.git`
6. Open the project with IntelliJ and let gradle build the project
7. If prompted, install java (17.0.5). Skip this step if you don't intend to work with java during the hackathon.
8. Install the npm dependencies with `cd angular-frontend` followed by `npm install`
9. Install the npm dependencies with `cd react-frontend` followed by `npm install`

During the hackathon your team can decide to use a custom branch on this GitHub repository or to fork it to your own
private repository.
