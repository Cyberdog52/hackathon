<h1>Tablut Rules</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The game is played on a 9Ã—9 board.</li>
  <li>The 16 attackers play against the 8 defenders and the king.</li>
  <li>The king starts on the central square known as the castle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moving</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Any piece can move any number of squares in a straight line. Like a rook in
    chess.
  </li>
  <li>No piece may ever pass over another piece in its path.</li>
  <li>Only the king may enter or move through the castle.</li>
  <li>
    A piece may be moved in between two enemy pieces without being captured.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Capturing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    To capture an enemy piece, it needs to be surrounded on opposing sides, but
    not diagonally.
  </li>
  <li>The empty castle counts as a hostile piece for both colors.</li>
  <li>Captured pieces are removed from the board.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The white defenders win if the king moves to the edge of the board.</li>
  <li>The black attackers win if they capture the king.</li>
  <li>
    Capturing the king inside the castle requires it to be surrounded on all
    four sides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Capturing the king next to the castle requires it to be surrounded on all
    three remaining sides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Capturing the king outside of the castle requires it to be surrounded on two
    opposite sides like any other piece.
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>White moves a piece from A1 to E1 (Notation A1E).</li>
