# Empowering AIdeas

You are tasked to create an application under the theme of *Empowering AIdeas*. \
To get you started, we have set up an example request to the OpenAI API.

## Setup

You can create a new account at https://platform.openai.com/.

You will have to create a new API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

By default you should get 5$ of free [usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage).

### Java

You will need to add your API key to the
[application.properties](./java-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

To facilitate the communication with OpenAI we decided to use https://github.com/TheoKanning/openai-java.
